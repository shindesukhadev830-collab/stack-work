# Simple Token â€“ Proof of Completion Without Content

## Project Description
This project provides a simple Clarity smart contract that allows users to submit a hash commitment as proof of course completion without revealing any underlying content. The contract enables anyone to verify the authenticity of a submitted proof by comparing hashes, preserving privacy and data confidentiality.

## Project Vision
To offer a straightforward, privacy-preserving way for learners to prove completion of courses or milestones on the blockchain. This method supports verifiable credentials without exposing sensitive exam data or personal information.

## Future Scope
- Extend to support issuer signatures to validate proof authenticity.
- Add revocation and expiry mechanisms for proofs.
- Integrate with decentralized identity (DID) solutions for better user control.
- Implement selective disclosure to reveal only certain attributes of a proof.
- Build a user-friendly frontend and wallet integration to ease proof submission and verification.
